fzf :purple-heart: devicon :heart: vim
===============

Things is a fork of `fzf.vim` that adds in support for devicons via the `devicon-lookup` tool

Installation
------------

fzf.devicon.vim depends on BOTH the basic Vim plugin of [the main fzf
repository][fzf] and [the fzf.vim plugin][fzf.vim] which means you need to **set up both "fzf" and
"fzf.vim" on Vim**.
[README-VIM][README-VIM].

[fzf-main]: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
[README-VIM]: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README-VIM.md

### Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
Plug 'coreyja/fzf.devicon.vim'
```

`fzf#install()` makes sure that you have the latest binary, but it's optional,
so you can omit it if you use a plugin manager that doesn't support hooks.

- Most commands support `CTRL-T` / `CTRL-X` / `CTRL-V` key
  bindings to open in a new tab, a new split, or in a new vertical split
- Bang-versions of the commands (e.g. `Ag!`) will open fzf in fullscreen
- You can set `g:fzf_command_prefix` to give the same prefix to the commands
    - e.g. `let g:fzf_command_prefix = 'Fzf'` and you have `FzfFiles`, etc.

(<a name="helptags">1</a>: `Helptags` will shadow the command of the same name
from [pathogen][pat]. But its functionality is still available via `call
pathogen#helptags()`. [↩](#a1))
